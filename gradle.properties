# When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.

# The Gradle build cache is a cache mechanism that aims to save time by reusing outputs
# produced by other builds. The build cache works by storing (locally or remotely) build
# outputs and allowing builds to fetch these outputs from the cache when it is determined
# that inputs have not changed, avoiding the expensive work of regenerating them.

# Run kapt, the Kotlin annotation processing tool, directly using Gradle workers.
# In some cases, this may significantly improve the overall build speed.
